This library was created during my stint at MOH where I had to automate the processing of FormSG forms after they were filled up. The official FormSG SDK is only written in JavaScript and Node.JS.

## Acknowledgement
After I developed this SDK in Oct 2021, I chanced upon a [repository](https://github.com/fivehealth/formsg-python-sdk) written by skylander86 to solve the exact same problem in Nov 2021. However, it did not support attachment decryption then which mine did. I eventually open-sourced mine in Jan 2022 when I had time.

I did learn from the way he structured his codes as it is my first time open-sourcing a project. Evidently, the logic is completely different.
